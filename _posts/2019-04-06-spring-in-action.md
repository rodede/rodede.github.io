Notes
=====
Spring offers a container, often referred to as the _Spring application context_, that creates and manages application components. These components, or beans, are **wired** together inside the Spring application context to make a complete application[...] -> dependency injection (DI)

Rather than have components create and maintain the lifecycle of other beans that they depend on, a dependency-injected application relies on a separate entity (the container) to create and maintain all components and inject those into the beans that need them. This is done typically through constructor arguments or property accessor methods.
